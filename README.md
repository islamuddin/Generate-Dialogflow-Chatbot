# Generate Dialogflow Chatbot

### This project is to generate zip file to import dataset to Dialogflow.

- You need to have:

1. Agent(file)
1. Package(file)
1. Intent(folder)-contains json files which we create using chatbotgenerator.ipynb after reading book1.csv

- Zip (agent,package,intent) together and upload to dialogflow using import. It will be working fine.

- If you find any problems with my code,do contribute or join and share your ideas here on [Dialogflow Chatbot Generator](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KBUEoyuISCh4h30F86xsGZ) whatsApp Group.

- Have a look at friendlybot.zip and smalltalk.zip created by using chatbot generator.
