# Generate Dialogflow Chatbot

### This project is to generate zip file to import dataset to Dialogflow.

###

- You need to have

1. agent(file)
1. package(file)
1. intent(folder)-contains json files which we create using chatbotgenerator.ipynb after reading book1.csv

- zip (agent,package,intent) together and upload to dialogflow using import. It will be working fine.

- if you find any problems with my code,do contribute or join and share your ideas here on [Dialogflow Chatbot Generator](https://chat.whatsapp.com/KBUEoyuISCh4h30F86xsGZ) whatsApp Group.

- Have a look at friendlybot.zip and smalltalk.zip created by using chatbot generator.
